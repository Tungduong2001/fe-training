                            The Mission Board of the EU Mission on Cancer has defined Comprehensive Cancer
                            Infrastructures as ‘national or regional infrastructures that provide resources and services
                            to support, improve and integrate cancer care, research, training of care professionals and
                            education for cancer patients, survivors and families/carers.’
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Today, the level of development of Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures and their
                            capacities, such as their digital, research and innovation-related capacities, vary
                            considerably across Member States and Associated Countries, leading to inequalities, in
                            particular in terms of research, quality and access to care.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Horizon Europe Mission on Cancer will complement the set-up across Member States and
                            several Associated Countries of an EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres that will be
                            established through the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan by 2025. The Mission aims to achieve
                            the target of ensuring that 90% of eligible cancer patients have access to Comprehensive
                            Cancer Infrastructures by 2030. In that context, this topic should set up, across Member
                            States and several Associated Countries, a capacity-building programme for countries of the
                            EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres to be established through the Europe’s Beating
                            Cancer Plan[1], to support them in improving or developing their existing or future
                            Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures, focussing on developing their digital, research &
                            innovation-related capacities and their integration with cancer care.

                            Proposals under this topic should aim at delivering results that are directed at and
                            contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
                            <br><br>
                            Research and health policy makers will benefit from support to further develop or set up
                            Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures, leading to improvement in terms of research and access
                            to care;<br>
                            Research and healthcare professionals will benefit from a better integration between
                            research and care;<br>
                            Researchers will benefit from innovative infrastructures to perform research and participate
                            in studies;<br>
                            Citizens, including patients and their caregivers will have enhanced access to screening,
                            diagnostics and treatments, improved care pathways and more integrated care. Their
                            involvement and participation to clinical trials will be facilitated. <br>
                            Scope: <br>
                            Building inter alia on the work carried out in several joint actions[2], the work of
                            organisations in the area of accreditation and certification[3], the work that will be
                            carried out under the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan[4], as well as existing[5] and potential
                            future mappings, a capacity-building programme should be set up for Member States and
                            several Associated Countries in the EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres, to be
                            established through the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, in order to help them develop or
                            further improve digital, research & innovation-related capacities of future or existing
                            Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures.
